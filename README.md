# Phone Sales Data Analysis Project using Power BI

## Overview
This Power BI project aims to analyze phone sales data, identify top-selling brands, operators, and distributors, and predict future sales trends in the mobile phone industry. By leveraging Power BI's visualization capabilities and DAX calculations, we aim to provide comprehensive insights into sales performance, revenue trends, and profitability.

## Key Findings
- **Total Revenue Trend**: Utilizing line charts, we observed a declining trend in total sales revenue for the year 2023.
- **Top Brands Analysis**: Effective DAX calculations were utilized to assess top brands such as Apple and LG, providing insights into their performance metrics including profit and revenue.
- **Operator Performance**: The Operator "Tuenti" was found to capture the highest revenue proportion with 34.31%.
- **Distributor Analysis**: Distributor "Tottus" was identified as having the highest revenue among all distributors.

## Project Files
- **Power BI Report**: The main Power BI report file (.pbix) is available in the repository, showcasing all visualizations and insights generated from the analysis.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for analysis is stored separately and can be linked to the Power BI report.
